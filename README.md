 🌱 I’m currently learning fullstack web developement at Microverse 🧑‍💻 I find myself as a fast learner🕵️‍♀️ I like doing quality work, and a real asshole on pull request reviews. 🧸 I'm proud of who I am, what I have built, and what I am building. 📫 The best way to reach me is to send me an email ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy dancing and celebrating with others after a long day's work. 💬 Feel free to ask me any question about JavaScript,React,Redux,Nodejs/CSS,HTML
